# ARIMA-Population-Analysis

In the arima_real.ipynb file I perform an analysis on POP.csv file. I walk through the necessary steps to determine the three parameters in the ARIMA(p,d,q) time series model using the statsmodels package in Python.

I then use the ARIMA model to split the data into a testing and training set to make forecasts in the future.
